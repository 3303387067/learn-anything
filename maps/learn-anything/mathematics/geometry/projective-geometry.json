    "note": "is the study of geometric properties that are invariant with respect to projective transformations  this means, that compared to elementary geometry, projective geometry has a different setting, projective space, and a selective set of basic geometric concepts  the bass intuitions are that projective space has more points than Euclidean space, for a given dimension, and that geometric transformations are permitted that transform the extra points (called ‘points at infinity’) to Euclidean points, and vice versa",
