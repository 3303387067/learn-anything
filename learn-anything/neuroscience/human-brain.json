      "note": "is a brain disorder characterised by compulsive engagement in rewarding stimuli, despite adverse consequences  despite the involvement of a number of psychosocial factors, a biological process – one which is induced by repeated exposure to an addictive stimulus – is the core pathology that drives the development and maintenance of an addiction  the two properties that characterise all addictive stimuli are that they are   reinforcing (i.e., they  increase the likelihood that a person will seek repeated exposure to them)   and intrinsically rewarding (i.e., perceived as being positive or desirable)",
