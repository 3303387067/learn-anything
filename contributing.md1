# Contributing to Learn Anything

## Code Organisation

## Setting Up the project locally
These instructions will allow you to set up your own instance of Learn Anything
to develop with.

To install the project you need to have [yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn), [node](https://github.com/nodejs/node), [DynamoDB]() and [Elasticsearch]().

### Install dependencies
1. [yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn) or [npm](https://github.com/npm/npm).
2. [node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node)
3. [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/). DynamoDB is a database used to manage and store maps. You can install and run it with:

```Bash
wget https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dynamodb-local/dynamodb_local_latest.zip
unzip -a dynamodb_local_latest.zip
java -Djava.library.path=./DynamoDBLocal_lib -jar DynamoDBLocal.jar -sharedDb
```

4. [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co). Elasticsearch is needed for fetching maps and suggestions on the website. You can install and run it with:

```Bash
wget https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-5.5.2.tar.gz
tar -zxf elasticsearch-5.5.2.tar.gz
./elasticsearch-5.5.2/bin/elasticsearch
```

### Run the project
1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the project, clone your fork:

```Bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/learn-anything.git

# Navigate to the newly cloned directory
cd learn-anything
```

2. `yarn` to install dependencies.
3. `yarn run setup`
3. `yarn start` to start the app.
4. Connect to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

The first time it may take a while, as all maps will be added to Elasticsearch.
After that only `yarn start` will be needed.

### Testing

> Tip: Keep your `master` branch pointing at the original repository and make
> pull requests from branches on your fork. To do this, run:
>
> ```
> git remote add upstream https://github.com/CompuIves/codesandbox-client.git
> git fetch upstream
> git branch --set-upstream-to=upstream/master master
> ```
>
> This will add the original repository as a "remote" called "upstream,"
> Then fetch the git information from that remote, then set your local `master`
> branch to use the upstream master branch whenever you run `git pull`.
> Then you can make all of your pull request branches based on this `master`
> branch. Whenever you want to update your version of `master`, do a regular
> `git pull`.

## Submitting a Pull Request
Please go through [existing issues](https://github.com/learn-anything/learn-anything/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/learn-anything/learn-anything/pulls) to check if somebody else is already working on the issue.

Also, make sure to run the tests before you commit your changes.

```
yarn test
```

Currently the test suite does not cover everything.
