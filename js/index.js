// TODO: user writes query, iframe is presented from below switch case, if query is the same

}

// TODO: add autosuggestions to search bar so users can see what results are available, perhaps there is a library

// TODO: for now just to get something working, make a switch case of all possible mind maps

// NOTE: queries can be prefixed by certain words to scope what the search is about
// i.e. if query is 'learn machine learning', mind map from 'learn anything' is shown
// if query is 'learn neural networks', mind map from 'learn anything - machine learning' is shown focused just on the 'neural networks' part
// other prexises may include 'interesting', i.e. 'interesting blogs on javascript' or 'interesting websites on education'
// list can go on but that should be taken into account

// TODO: add header text displaying that mind map can be improved if user disagrees with contents of it

// TODO: remove iframe when user starts typing a query again
