[Learn Anything](https://learn-anything.xyz/) is an Open Source Website built by community to Learn Anything with Interactive Maps.

This project was created to allow anyone to learn anything in the most efficient way possible by finding the best resources available for learning as well as exploring visually how every topic connects to one another. We wrote a [White Paper](https://github.com/learn-anything/learn-anything/wiki/White-Paper) that goes into why this project came to exist in more detail.

For more information, you can read [our wiki](https://github.com/learn-anything/learn-anything/wiki) and join our [active Slack group](https://join.slack.com/t/learnanythingxyz/shared_invite/enQtMjg1MTcxMjA4NDg2LWU0YjgxZTZmZGY5MTRlMWI3ZWJjYzNhYTg4MmE1OTRjNTQ2MjUwYWI3ZGZlZjg1MDA0OTc3ZDY3ZmMzZDc4N2I).

## Contributing
You can contribute to the website in many ways. The easiest thing you can do to help is to simply use the website and learn things with it. And if you found a resource you like, just add it so everyone can find it too.

Since this website is fully Open Source, you can help and add new and awesome features to the website. Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-to-learn-anything) file for how you can do this.

If you have never programmed before and this is your first Open Source project, don't be afraid to join in. There are many people that can help you both get started and make your first contribution.

## Curated Lists
With our goal of providing the most efficient paths for Learning Anything, we also manage curation of various curated lists. Feel free to [explore and improve them if you wish](https://github.com/learn-anything/learn-anything/wiki/Curated-Lists).

## API
[Here](http://docs.learn-anything.xyz/) you can find all the public API endpoints we currently have. We will be adding more in the future.

Below are some things people have built with the API we provide. If you built something yourself, feel free to add it to this list.
- [Alfred Workflow](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-learn-anything) - Alfred workflow to search through all Learn Anything maps.
- [Albert Plugin](https://github.com/nglgzz/albert-plugins) - Albert plugin to search through all Learn Anything maps.

## Keep this project going ðŸ’œ
This project is **built by the community, for the community** and in our goals to make the most efficient paths and the best user experience possible in exploring the maps and finding the resources you need, we can only rely on donations made by our users to sustain this project.

There are **no advertisements** and **no sponsored content** in this website as that would defeat our vision of making the best and most optimal learning tracks for learning any topic in the world.

We have created a [Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/learnanything) where you can support our work. Any donation that you make to this project is incredibly valuable to keep this project going. We also have some awesome rewards that come with your support.
