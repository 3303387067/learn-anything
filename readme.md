The image above is an [interactive mind map that can be viewed and explored](https://learn-anything.xyz/learn_anything) as well as [searched through](https://learn-anything.xyz). 🔎

There are **many mind maps inside** which show the **best step by step guides you can use to learn the subject in depth**. 
  
Each node with a link has an emoji attached to show where this node leads on the internet. Nodes with 🗺 are other mind maps. 

Just search for what you wish to learn or [simply explore](https://learn-anything.xyz/learn-anything).
  
If you think that there is a better way one can learn the subject or you wish something was added or you found a mistake, you can help improve it. Just [click on the 🦄](http://i.imgur.com/Qpi9xZK.png) and say what you wish was added or changed.

The search engine is [fully open source](https://github.com/learn-anything/search) and you can help improve it. 💙

The [main goal of this project](https://learn-anything.github.io/future/2017/05/27/future-of-learning.html) is to **expose human knowledge in a visual and structured way to accelerate learning**. 🚀


<h1 align="center"><a href="https://knowledge-map.slack.com/shared_invite/MTgxNTYzMjIzNjM5LTE0OTQzMzA4MDAtYzY1YWY0ZDc0NQ">Community 👬</a></h1>

Both this project and the search engine [is in active development](https://github.com/learn-anything/search-engine). If you want to help improve it in any way or want to join an ever growing community of learners, you can join our active [Slack group](https://knowledge-map.slack.com/shared_invite/MTgxNTYzMjIzNjM5LTE0OTQzMzA4MDAtYzY1YWY0ZDc0NQ) where you can either help with expanding content of the mind maps, help with the development and adding features to our [Search Engine](https://github.com/learn-anything/search-engine) or create a study group for any branch in the mind map and learn together.  

<h2 align="center"><a href="https://learn-anything.github.io">Our Blog 📚</a></h2>

You can also read through our [development blog](https://learn-anything.github.io) which outlines all the problems we are trying to solve to make the [Search Engine](https://github.com/learn-anything/search-engine) and Mind Map curation as best as it can be. 

We use [Twitter](https://twitter.com/learnanything_) to announce new things like new queries that were added, [blog articles](https://learn-anything.github.io) that were written and more. 🐦

<h1 align="center"><a href="https://learn-anything.github.io/2017/06/15/contributing.html">Contributing 👬</a> </a></h1>

There are many ways in which you can help. But before you do, it is best to read [why we created this search engine and what problems we are trying to solve](https://learn-anything.github.io/future/2017/05/27/future-of-learning.html). You can also join [our Slack group](https://knowledge-map.slack.com/shared_invite/MTgxNTYzMjIzNjM5LTE0OTQzMzA4MDAtYzY1YWY0ZDc0NQ) as that is where all communication regarding this project takes place.

You can then read [our article](https://learn-anything.github.io/2017/06/15/contributing.html) that goes over all the different ways in which you can contribute to this project. 💙


<h1 align="center"> <a href="https://learn-anything.github.io/2017/06/15/roadmap.html">Our Roadmap 🔭</a> </h1>

We [wrote an article](https://learn-anything.github.io/2017/06/15/roadmap.html) outlying all the steps we hope to take to make this dream of making a community powered Search Engine and Mind Maps come true.


<h1 align="center"><a href="https://www.patreon.com/learnanything">Keep this project going 💚</a></h1>

This project is **built by the community, for the community** and in our goals to make the most efficient path and the best user experience possible in exploring the mind maps and finding the resources you need, we can only rely on donations made by our users to sustain this project.

There are **no advertisements** and **no sponsored content** in this Search Engine as that would defeat our vision of making the best and most optimal learning tracks for learning any topic in the world.
 
We have created a [Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/learnanything) where you can support our work. Any donation that you make to this project is incredibly valuable to keep this project going. We also have some awesome rewards that come with your support.  

Thank you. 💚
