# [Mind Map Search Engine](http://nikitavoloboev.xyz/knowledge-map-search-engine/)

# Idea ðŸ’¡

I want to build a search engine similar to [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) but instead of providing a static set of links, I provide a mind map of best of the best peer reviewed resources one can collect to learn each of the topics. 

It's purpose is to let users query [the big mind map of knowledge](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map) and receive visual mind maps that one can explore with links, videos, articles, gifs that help learn the subject at hand.

As I wish for this to be a community project where everyone can add their resource that they have found or made, I want this project to be fully open source.


# Implementation ðŸš€

I wrote a [list of todos of how I plan to implement a first working prototype](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map-search-engine/blob/master/js/index.js).
