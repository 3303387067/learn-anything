# [Mind Map Search Engine](http://nikitavoloboev.xyz/knowledge-map-search-engine/)

# Idea ðŸ’¡

I want to build a search engine similar to [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) but instead of providing a static set of links, I provide a mind map of best of the best peer reviewed resources one can use to learn each of the topics. 

It's purpose is to let users query [the big mind map of knowledge](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map) and receive visual mind maps that one can explore with links, videos, articles, gifs that help learn the subject at hand.

As I wish for this to be a community project where everyone can add their resource that they have found or made, I want this project to be fully open source.

The search engine index is fully transparent and can be seen [here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map). It should cover any one topic one may want to learn from learning 'calculus' to learning about 'neural networks' and it would provide a visual overview of how to fully acquire this knowledge in the most efficient way possible as well as show how every topic that you are trying to learn connects. 

As all the mind maps are avaialble for all to see, anyone can come in and propose changes to it, however links and resources should be of high quality. The focus of this search engine is not to index everything there exists like what conventional search engines do, instead it should provide visual 'human reviewed' links and resources and ideally provide resources for learning in a 'step by step' manner similar to what can be seen [here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map/tree/master/learning-mindmaps).

# Implementation ðŸš€

I wrote a [list of todos of how I plan to implement a first working prototype](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map-search-engine/blob/master/js/index.js).
