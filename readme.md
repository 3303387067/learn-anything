<h2 align="center"><a href="https://knowledge-map.slack.com/shared_invite/MTgxNTYzMjIzNjM5LTE0OTQzMzA4MDAtYzY1YWY0ZDc0NQ">Community 👬</a></h2>

Both this project and the search engine [is in active development](https://learn-anything.github.io). If you want to help improve it in any way or want to join an ever growing community of learners, you can join our active [slack group](https://knowledge-map.slack.com/shared_invite/MTgxNTYzMjIzNjM5LTE0OTQzMzA4MDAtYzY1YWY0ZDc0NQ) where you can either help with expanding content of the mind maps, help with the development and adding features to the [search engine](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/learn-anything-search) or create a study group for any branch in the mind map and learn together. 

<h2 align="center"><a href="https://learn-anything.github.io">Our Blog 📚</a></h2>

You can also read though our [development blog](https://learn-anything.github.io) which outlines all the problems we are trying to solve in [our road to move this project to scale with community](https://learn-anything.github.io/automation/2017/05/20/Automating-the-contribution-system.html).

We use [Twitter](https://twitter.com/learnanything_) to announce new things like new queries that were added, [blog articles](https://learn-anything.github.io) that were written and more. 🐦

<h2 align="center"><a href="https://github.com/learn-anything/books">Books 📚</a> and <a href="https://github.com/learn-anything/courses">Courses 📝</a></h2>

There is also a [list of books](https://github.com/learn-anything/books) and [free courses](https://github.com/learn-anything/courses) you can take a look at and help improve. 💚


<h1 align="center">Contributing 👬 </a></h1>

If you want to help make this dream of visualising all of world's knowledge in this way a reality, you can help in many ways.

## Help with improving the mind maps 🗺

Take some time to explore [the mind map](https://learn-anything.xyz/learn_anything) or just search through topics you would like to learn with the [search engine](https://learn-anything.xyz).

- Do you think some topic can be covered in a more efficient way? 
- Or perhaps something can be added to deepen the understanding of the topic? 
- Or the order with how material should be tackled should be different?
- Or you wish some other topic was covered that is not currently included?

As mentioned above, there is a [button with a 🦄](http://i.imgur.com/Qpi9xZK.png) present in all of the mind maps which will link to a GitHub issue where you can propose to improve the mind map.

Just say what you wish was added or removed or changed and why. The content has to be of value and free content is preferred. If you wish to extend them mind map further, you can also say that in the issue.

If you want to propose a completely new mind map or have some other question or feedback that you don't want to ask in our [slack group](https://knowledge-map.slack.com/shared_invite/MTgxNTYzMjIzNjM5LTE0OTQzMzA4MDAtYzY1YWY0ZDc0NQ), you can open a [new issue](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/learn-anything/issues/new) and say what you wish was added.

## Help with developing the search engine for mind maps on the web 🔎 

We are currently attempting to move [our current renderer for mind maps](https://github.com/learn-anything/react-mindmap) to [D3.js](https://github.com/d3/d3) in our plans to fully open source and ease contribution and user experience of exploring the mind maps. 

If you want to help, that's great. Join our [slack group](https://knowledge-map.slack.com/shared_invite/MTgxNTYzMjIzNjM5LTE0OTQzMzA4MDAtYzY1YWY0ZDc0NQ) and we can discuss ideas and work on it together. 💚

<h2 align="center"> Future 🚀 </h2>

We [plan to ease the contributing process](https://ducksource.github.io/internet/tech/2017/05/15/human-curated-backend.html) as much as possible so there is no friction in proposing to add changes and integrating them into the mind maps. 

Each mind map will also have [flash cards](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/research/tree/master/anki) that you can use to consolidate this knowledge.

The focus of the search engine is to search through an [open index of knowledge that all can see and explore and contribute to](https://learn-anything.github.io/future/2017/05/27/future-of-learning.html). It should categorise knowledge in a way that allows linear progression of learning each of the topics. There should be no black box where everything is hidden behind a search bar, if you want to explore, [you can](https://learn-anything.xyz/learn_anything). 

The end goal is to make an interactive mind map of all of world's knowledge that all can explore. 🔭


<h2 align="center"><a href="https://www.patreon.com/nikitavoloboev">Keep this project going 🎊</a></h2>

This project is still in its early stages but I am certain as it gets traction and people actually start both using and contributing content to it, the popularity will grow. As more people visit and spend time exploring these mind maps, the cost of maintaining and hosting thousands of these mind maps will grow. I would hate to shut down this project for these reasons. 

I also don't want to put any advertisements or any 'sponsored' content in there that I don't think brings value. I want these study plans to present the most efficient ways one can learn any subject one may want to learn in a guided way.

If you do love using these mind maps, I have started a [Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/nikitavoloboev) where you can support this work, if you wish. There are also some really cool rewards that come with your support. 💚

Fun fact. 💡 This project started off as a [single mind map](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3bsw537ggy7u0zf/original.png?dl=1) but it grew too big. 

<h2 align="center"> Stay in touch 📮 </h2>

Aside from the [active slack group](https://knowledge-map.slack.com/shared_invite/MTgxNTYzMjIzNjM5LTE0OTQzMzA4MDAtYzY1YWY0ZDc0NQ) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/learnanything_), there is also a small [newsletter](http://twitter.us13.list-manage2.com/subscribe?u=b7f276d58f5c5f7136eff955d&id=12378547f7) that you can sign up for to get short emails with updates on this project.

There is also [our own reddit subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/knowledgemap/) where you can talk and share your discoveries or ask questions. 

#### [My Personal Articles 📖](https://my.mindnode.com/2YJ1yeqHkxaBMHKDPC1k2Ripxpx9Ne7ULk4rfh3H#114.2,-459.4,2)

I love writing. I find the act of writing really enjoyable as I try to condense information in a way that another person can understand. 

#### [My GitHub Repositories 👾](https://my.mindnode.com/ZKGETDkUaQUsL3q8q9z788CxG84oEHgDiT79GuzX#135.1,-901.8,2)
